## Verse

Pool is filled with lemon sessions  
with rounded corners and tempting bees  
Use the boat from deceised mansions  
Carry the leak far from the trees  

## Prechorus

Hold the silence  
Follow the fear  
Before I'll say the end is  

## Chorus

Wheel is turning around  
Nowhere to be found  
The little pieces you dropped on your way  
  
Crawl the animal out  
Somewhere to be found  
Between the dolls you play with all day  

## Verse

Moan in the light of sharing passion  
Send the balance tapping on your knees  
Seize the charm from moving tension  
Send the peak waiting on my peace  

## Prechorus

Hold the silence  
Follow the fear  
Before I'll say the end is  

## Chorus

Wheel is turning around  
Nowhere to be found  
The little pieces you dropped on your way  
  
Crawl the animal out  
Somewhere to be found  
Between the dolls you play with all day  

## Prechorus

Hold the silence  
Follow the fear  
Before I'll say the end is
