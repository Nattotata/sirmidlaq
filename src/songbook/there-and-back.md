It's rainy outside,  
Beautiful shiny roads of nature  
Journey begain in a digital realm  
Between killin' enemy creatures  
  
Or there and back again  
We walk with our heads up high  
  
Discovering secrets on our own   
And hand the meaning to our souls  
Jumping over reality that we've known  
  
It's poetic night but the word revolver doesn't sound right  
Scooter just past us by  
It's time to get on a bus to follow the taste of stars  
  
Or there and back again  
We walk with our heads up high  
  
Discovering secrets on our own   
And hand the meaning to our souls  
Jumping over reality that we've known  
  
Lay on the grass it sure is wet  
Why should it bother us just play dead  
Explore the mystic mountains  
Leave the sign of angels in the stony fountain  
  
Walking through the valley of wise ones  
Widson is glowing from striking the ground lines  
Haven for the knowledge of your own kind
