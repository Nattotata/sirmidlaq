### Verse

Voodoo is my new hobby  
Hurting other people  
While playing with my fluffy dolls  
You would barely notice  
Something is awfully wrong  
  
Eyes won't see the blue light  
Broken glasses, violent kisses  
There won't be any sleep tonight  
Just dark red blood dripping  
On your woken dreams  
  
### Chorus

Oh sweet witch  
Your spells work just fine  
You shouldn't be mine  
So why won't you eat my heart  
  
Oh sweet witch  
Your spells work just fine  
You shouldn't be mine  
So why won't you eat my heart  

### Verse

Magic is easy to mess with  
Casting spells reckless ends with  
My body parts lying and you are vainly trying  
To catch one last fulfilling breath  
  
Hurricane is what we need now  
Little wind comin' through the window  
Upside down cross sittin'  
On the top of the mountain  
A sacrifice that must be done  

### Chorus

Oh sweet witch your spells work just fine  
You shouldn't be mine  
So why won't you eat my heart  


### Outro
I tore your face off until your bones fall apart  
You are my playdoll and for you I'm a god
