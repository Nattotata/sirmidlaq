Sky looks very blurry tonight  
Looking' through the corn liquid light  
Lean on gettin' eaten to ground by  
Swarm forming to  
Thoughts of you  
  
Bass hits on the circus tent  
Causing the energy to bump to each other  
You cannot capture that moment  
When trees clinch roots one to the other  
  
We've been marked by a sort of sacred cult  
We denied to follow a strong sensation  
We've been marked by a sacred cult  
We denied we've been gifted a second round  
  
Two pieces of magical grain  
Swimming to island of powerful ways  
Searching for the moment  
Seek my hand through the colorful beams  
  
We've been marked by the sacred cult  
We denied to follow a strong sensation  
We've been marked by a sacred cult  
We denied we've been figted a second round  
We lean on each other  
United energies in bowl of having a life together
