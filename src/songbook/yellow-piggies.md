## Verse

Slingshot made of maple branches  
could not shoot icecream feeding piggies  
blind enough to touch every made up story  
I hate too much

::C5::I still would not ::D5::disappear

::C5::I still would not ::D5::disappear

## Verse

Yellow is my favourite color of stars  
Bellow the need, I would split you in half  
Ita quater past ten, put the wierd smile away  
lets throw a party down here  
I am on my way

## Chorus

::D::Already here while Iam not::F:: seeing clear

::G::plane could crush into your dreams and

::C5::I still would not ::D5::disappear

::D::Already here while Iam not::F:: seeing clear

::G::plane could crush into your dreams and

::C5::I still would not ::D5::disappear

Allow me to see the animal outside the pissed hay  
you know me  
Nothing ever stops the truck headin your way
