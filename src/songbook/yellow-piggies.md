Slingshot made of maple branches  
could not shoot icecream feeding piggies  
blind enough to touch every made up story  
I hate too much  
Already here while Iam not seeing clear  
plane could crush into your dreams and  
I still would not disappear  
Yellow is my favourite color of stars  
Bellow the need, I would split you in half  
Ita quater past ten, put the wierd smile away  
lets throw a party down here  
I am on my way  
Already here while Iam not seeing clear  
plane could crush into your dreams and  
I still would not disappear  
Allow me to see the animal outside the pissed hay  
you know me  
Nothing ever stops the truck headin your way
