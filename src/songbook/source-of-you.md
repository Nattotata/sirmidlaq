**Chords** Gmi **Chords**

How would you feel

**Chords** B E **Chords**

If I had your hair in my hand

**Chords** Gmi **Chords**

I know it isn't real

**Chords** B E **Chords**

But I can reach out and pretend


**Chords** E A **Chords**

Having the source of you

**Chords** C **Chords**

Laying in my pocket

**Chords** E A **Chords**

Changin' my point of view

**Chords** C **Chords**

With your eye sockets


**Chords** Gmi **Chords**

Why is it goin' through

**Chords** B E **Chords**

My imagination

**Chords** Gmi **Chords**

Gently grated stew from your nails

**Chords** B E **Chords**

Would cause a levitation

Of my heart


**Chords** E A **Chords**

Having the source of you

**Chords** C **Chords**

Laying in my pocket

**Chords** E A **Chords**

Changin' my point of view

**Chords** C **Chords**

With your eye sockets


**Chords** C#mi D#dim **Chords**

I'm high on your heels what does it mean

**Chords** G#mi B **Chords**

Carefully picking the skin on your knees

**Chords** C#mi D#dim **Chords**

You relly on my dreams what does it mean

**Chords** G#mi B **Chords**

That you are leaving the home in one piece


**Chords** E A **Chords**

Having the source of you

**Chords** C **Chords**

Laying in my pocket

**Chords** E A **Chords**

Changin' my point of view

**Chords** C **Chords**

With your eye sockets
