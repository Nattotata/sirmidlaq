## Verse

Rare ink in my drawer  
brought light upon my saw  
and I am cutting through the thicc matter  
hoping tomorrow will be better

Nothing in the store to go  
five days in the raw  
and I am cutting through the thicc matter  
hoping tomorrow will be better

## Chorus

Everyday use is my daily juice  
everyday juice is my favorite use  
growing to smite me  
holdin the nightmare

Everyday use is my daily juice  
everyday juice is my favorite use  
growing to smite me  
holdin the nightmare

## Verse

Chip is burried in my skull  
finding way  
and I am cutting through the thicc matter  
hoping tomorrow will be better

Bend and tame the other mind  
kept from you and out of sight

And I am cutting through the thicc matter  
hoping tomorrow will be better

## Chorus

Everyday use is my daily juice  
everyday juice is my favorite use  
growing to smite me  
holdin the nightmare

Everyday use is my daily juice  
everyday juice is my favorite use  
growing to smite me  
holdin the nightmare
