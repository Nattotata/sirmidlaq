## Verse

Could you please hold this for me  
Only for a second for a second time this week  
Do you need anything from me  
All you seek is nothing that you'll ever receive.  

## Chorus

So this is it angels are coming to solve double homicide  
  
In a garden maze on a high end state  
Heavily stabbed and then dumped in lake  
In a garden maze on a high end state  
Melody backed up rain to wash the stains  

## Verse

What do you mean this is for free  
It's only for a second for a second time this week  
I know you have nothing on me  
So you speak roughly a word on a highest peak  

## Chorus

So this is it angels are coming to solve double homicide  
  
In a garden maze on a high end state  
Heavily stabbed and then dumped in lake  
In a garden maze on a high end state  
Melody backed up rain to wash the stains  

## Verse

I'm not the fallen one saying it's selfish  
Caring with soul undone  
Caring with soul undone  
I'm not the fallen one saying it's selfish  

## Chorus

So this is it angels are coming to solve double homicide  
  
In a garden maze on a high end state  
Heavily stabbed and then dumped in lake  
In a garden maze on a high end state  
Melody backed up rain to wash the stains
