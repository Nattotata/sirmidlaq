Capo: 4

### Verse

**Chords** D **Chords**

Silent upper hills consumed by snow

**Chords** B5/E **Chords**

Broken ebony trees crossing the road

**Chords** G A **Chords**

Figure staring at you where you seem low


**Chords** D **Chords**

Rushing towards the edge of the mountain

**Chords** B5/E **Chords**

Spiraling thought that are grabbin' the body

**Chords** G A **Chords**

What is it that calls upon me and keeps me taunted

### Chorus

**Chords** D Bmi **Chords**

Careful stranger this isn't a dream

**Chords** G E **Chords**

Come closer coward to finally see

**Chords** D Bmi **Chords**

Touch the ground to feele my heart grow

**Chords** G **Chords**

Gather the bones and replace the lies

**Chords** E E7 **Chords**

With unconditional love underneath the ice

### Verse

**Chords** D **Chords**

Silent upper hills returned my soul

**Chords** B5/E **Chords**

Trees are thriving along the road

**Chords** G A **Chords**

Figure is gone now it's bride that I know (or knows?)


**Chords** D **Chords**

Rushing again from the powerless fountain

**Chords** B5/E **Chords**

Spinning the world and all the things around it

**Chords** G A **Chords**

What is it that calls upon me and keeps me taunted

### Chorus

**Chords** D Bmi **Chords**

Careful stranger this isn't a dream

**Chords** G E **Chords**

Come closer coward to finally see

**Chords** D Bmi **Chords**

Touch the ground to feele my heart grow

**Chords** G **Chords**

Gather the bones and replace the lies

**Chords** E E7 **Chords**

With unconditional love underneath the ice
