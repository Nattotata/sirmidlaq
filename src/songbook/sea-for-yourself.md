Warm up before  
Night  
Night

Sail on the sea of body parts having laugh  
Water is getting cold  
THe black sky is reflection of your soul merging with the boat

These waters are banned for you  
The moon would shoot you on sight  
You should prepare and warm up before night  
Night  
Night  
Night  
Night

Salt is buring your skin  
Blue ice came through the nose  
Of the wooden chin  
With the right amount of overdose

Stuck and cold even more than before  
But there is still one light

You should prepare and warm up  
Before night  
Night  
Night  
Night  
Night

Wreckage is floating through the wasteland  
The unholy are eating from my hand  
What's left over the captain dry head

Warm up before
