No clue why, is this glue sticky  
It should be fine by now  
This strcture collapsed with help  
From a weird shaped shade  
It's unseed and it doesn't talk the way  
The same way we do  
  
Do you see the person  
Standin' behind you  
Would you be just fine if I'd stop being around you  
  
The piss is pissing me of the roofs  
Made by hippie hippos more trash  
Than the trash they produce  
Talkin' is expensive  
I'd rather type with my toes  
  
I can't stand by and listen  
To your waves by the shores  
  
Do you see the person  
Standin' behind you  
Would you be just fine if I'd stop being around you  
  
You'll be just fine  
I'll give you an icecream that's  
Three times bigger than mine
