### Verse

**Chords** B E **Chords**

There's a fairy in my house flying over my head

**Chords** D A **Chords**

Solvin' all the puzzles that would knock me over

**Chords** B E **Chords**

carin in the sake of not makin me sad

**Chords** D A **Chords**

lean over pillows that she touches instead

### Prechorus

**Chords** B A D **Chords**

Of sneakily makin you eat your own heart  
Fillin the scenes of your brain for your whole life  
I am ready to give up my soul  
to share the known light  
There is fairy on a beach flying over my head n  
trees under water waitin to grow on you  
layin on the seat for your tone of life bet  
lean over shadows that she touches instead  
Of sneakily makin you eat your own heart  
Fillin the scenes of your brain for your whole life  
I am ready to give up my soul  
to share the known light  
I ll bath in a fuel for enernity  
if you  
Sniff every part of me  
Wearin all your dust on me  
Ill grow you a butter pear for eternity  
now taste every part of me  
throw all your dust on me
