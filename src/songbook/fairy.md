### Verse

There's a ::Bm::fairy in my house flying ::Esus2::over my head

::D::Solvin' all the puzzles that would ::C#m/A::knock me over

::Bm::Carin' in the sake of not ::Esus2::makin me sad

::D::Lean over pillows that she ::C#m/A::touches instead

### Prechorus

::B::Of sneakily ::A::makin you eat your ::D::own heart   ::Db5::---------::D::

Fillin the scenes of your brain for your whole life

I am ready to give up my soul

to share the known light

There is fairy on a beach flying over my head n

trees under water waitin to grow on you

layin on the seat for your tone of life bet

lean over shadows that she touches instead

Of sneakily makin you eat your own heart

Fillin the scenes of your brain for your whole life

I am ready to give up my soul

to share the known light

I ll bath in a fuel for enernity

if you

Sniff every part of me

Wearin all your dust on me

Ill grow you a butter pear for eternity

now taste every part of me

throw all your dust on me
