## Verse

Could you please hold this for me  
only for a second for second time this week  
do you need anything from me  
all you seek is nothing that you'll ever receive

So this is it angels are coming to solve double homicide

## Chorus

In a garden maze on a high end state  
Heavily stabbed and then dumbed in lake  
In a garden maze on a high end state  
tell the melody to wash the stains

## Verse

What do you mean this is for free  
it's only for a second for second time this week  
I know you have nothing on me  
so you speak roughly a word on a highest peak

So this is it angels are coming to solve double homicide

## Chorus

In a garden maze on a high end state  
Heavily stabbed and then dumbed in lake  
In a garden maze on a high end state  
tell the melody to wash the stains

## Interlude

I'm not the only one saying it's selfish  
I'm not the one that's ready to murder you

## Chorus

In a garden maze on a high end state  
Heavily stabbed and then dumbed in lake  
In a garden maze on a high end state  
tell the melody to wash the stains
