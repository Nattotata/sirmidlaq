Aiming high  
stare at us even if you didn't notice  
Omen sign  
better believe in us eatin the lotus

View that charmed us away from our regular hit and runs  
Don't you know I am putting my faith  
away from the end of our doubts

Private jet is waitin  
till you get on board  
seat is heated with fine view of  
a parade horde

Paint in mine  
hidious stages of all the failing organs  
curing blind  
with omnious flight over balding mountains

view that charmed us away from our regular hit and runs  
don't you know I am puttin my faith  
away from the end of our doubts

Private jet is waitin  
till you get on board  
seat is heated with five view of  
a parade horde

fasten your seatbelts  
jet is crushing for sure

and it's gonna be beautiful
