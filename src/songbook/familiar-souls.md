Do you like my picture of a seal  
hiding behind the scenes of sharing  
fears  
would you mind if I bond to your joyful tears  
having tea in the afternoon  
You won't hold back getting' me through

The life that is going to kill me soon

After all the secrets that we shared tonight  
I've got on doubt we are linked through the eternal damages

Would you like to play chess with me  
I know we don't have our bread to eat jar of pickels with  
Watching over your powerful treats

After all the secrets that we shared tonight  
I've got on doubt we are linked through the eternal damages

Gettin' daily dose of calming octopus taste  
Your voice is the calming stone of all human race
Breath in the energy of disconnection
Till we join again without perfection
