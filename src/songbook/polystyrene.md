## Verse

::Bm::Damp dark ::A#::tree bark

::Asus2::cold feet ::F::no heatchc

::Bm::dead fly ::A#::night sky

::Asus2::under the floors ::F::made out of doors

Dog howl barn owl

crawl fast white grass

alley cat go back

burned smell empty shell

## Prechorus

::Bm::Spider web can't ::F::hold me back

::A::Dry cat piss don't ::G::make me fret

::Bm::used to be a ::F::big pack

::A::miss their phonetic::G:: alphabet

## Chorus

::D::Tonight we dine ::F::polystyrene

::E::There's not much ::C::here to eat

::D::It's hard to ::F::keep this routine

::E::I just want ::C::to sleep

Tonight we dine polystyrene

Day's are getting short

Never cared much 'bout cuisine

Why is it so cold

## Bridge

Used to be many but now there are few

Why do you keep filling

Traps with berries we had to walk through

Why do you keep killing

Brothers and sisters just bodies in queue

Still we will be drilling

Used to be many but now there are few

Why do you keep filling

Traps with berries we had to walk through

Why do you keep killing

Brothers and sisters just bodies in queue

Still we will be drilling
