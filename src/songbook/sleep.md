### Verse

Beneath the unknown holy construction  
Where lays my last little bit of action  
Meet the couple of raw mountains  
As the thing to catch me off guard  

### Prechorus

Easy to believe  
That there is nothing to see  
In the blizzard  
That's keeping you from tip of the cliff  
  
It's just so much better than loosing your consciousness  

### Chorus

All you want is sleep  
Holding someone to breath  
Up close in a hair  
You want so painfully freeze  
  
All you want is breath  
Holding someone to sleep  
Up close in the lair  
Of maggots waiting to eat  

### Verse

Lean on the pressure of the pleasant numbness  
Sweet side is picking up droping boneless  
Meet the couple of raw mountains  
As the thing to catch me off guard  

### Prechorus

Easy to believe  
That there is nothing to see  
In the blizzard  
That's keeping you from tip of the cliff  
  
It's just so much better than loosing your consciousness  

### Chorus

All you want is sleep  
Holding someone to breath  
Up close in a hair  
You want so painfully freeze  
  
All you want is breath  
Holding someone to sleep  
Up close in the lair  
Of maggots waiting to eat
