title: Big time
---

Careful with a needle it's sharp as far as I can tell  
Plant a minor seed it's worth a while as much as I can spend  
  
Hold someone you already know  
Bet on the sparks of the soul  
That settles the obvious role  
  
Big time we are all done  
These times leaving all that  
For the ever after once upon  
  
Big time we are all done  
These times leaving all that  
For the ever after once upon  
  
Breathing the same air is healing as far as I can tell  
Blame it on eternity is all that I can spend  
  
Hold someone you already know  
Bet on the sparks of the soul  
That settles the obvious role  
  
Big time we are all done  
These times leaving all that  
For the ever after once upon  
  
Big time we are all done  
These times leaving all that  
For the ever after once upon
