Don't stare to field like

heaven is meant to be

sins driven by keen mind

hold my sympathy

change what you'd like to see

paying' to be real knight

chain yourself to a broad belief

self-desctructing pleed

I am bloody vicar not holdin' you here

Prayin' senseless

that these wall have been rendered thiccer than me

nailed with jesus

in sort of a paradise

bring in the heat pipe

train your brain to sleep

tempted by the sea side

with heavyweight centipede

lay in a coat of a nun

still you remain by the law

I am bloody vicar not holdin' you here

praying senseless

that these walls have been rendered thiccer than me

nailed with jesus

in sort of a paradise
