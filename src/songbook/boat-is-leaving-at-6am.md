### Verse

Two steady boats on a whole wide river  
Sailing on the spot to another level  
  
Jumping around and with powerful stomps  
Sliding their boots on a sticky ground  
  
### Chorus

Bridge over to the wild  
It's closer than you think but further from your mind  
I think I'll jump to merge with my own kind  
  
### Verse

Person with red hair lit your inner fire  
We failed to not end up behind the curtain of desire  
  
Humans shining more than ever  
Hiding the old faces behind blowing bubbles  
  
### Chorus

Bridge over to the wild  
It's closer than you think but further from your mind  
I think I'll jump to merge with my own kind  
  
### Outro

The world outside is very bright  
Things are in motion  
This should be last of my  
Toxic potions
