### Verse

**Chords** Bm **Chords**

Hell and back, faith is the last thing keeping me safe

Imprisoned hounds, tearing apart

The shell that I bear along 'till the end of time

Choose your dress princess

I'll be waiting nearby

We shall rise to heaven

**Chords** F#m **Chords**

With the pillow we bought

**Chords** G A **Chords**

It's number seven

**Chords** Em7 Bm7 **Chords**

We shall rise to heaven

**Chords** F#m **Chords**

With the pillow we bought

**Chords** G A **Chords**

It's number seven

### Verse

**Chords** Bm **Chords**

Death is upon us, with cold wet hands

**Chords** Bm **Chords**

Dear god can we swap our pants

**Chords** A Bm **Chords**

Mine aren't as clean as yours

**Chords** Bm **Chords**

But it's the only thing that can redeem

**Chords** Bm **Chords**

Soul we both posses

I'll be waiting nearby

Anxiety is royalty

**Chords** Bm G **Chords**

And you're my queen of bending fear

Insanity took over me

**Chords** Bm F#m **Chords**

Rising guilt has liquid color theme

With the pillow we bought
