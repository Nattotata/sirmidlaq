Father  
the holy spirit has left me  
Tellin the truth my job  
lifting me up isnt everything why I went down here  
theres so much to take  
so much to inhale raw  
rust just took over  
splitting the shiny parts  
with enforced order  
Ill rather  
Live in the heaven that I kept near  
my heart isnt the one I love  
lifting me up isnt everything why I went down here  
Another  
calling in the night and I cant breathe  
My body shouldnt pay for my job  
dragin me down isnt the only thing why I went up here  
theres so much to take  
so much to inhale raw  
rust just took over  
splitting the shiny parts  
with enforced order  
link your lungs to mine before  
you realize you should have never done that  
wear the helmet for the safety reasons  
poor mans skull is better utacked
