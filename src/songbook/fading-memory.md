The colors are shining upon the church  
Projecting feelings of the crowd  
Confused strangers sharing the joy of the sacred moment  
And you are right here in the night

With your smile you heal syndroms up and down  
While you cause the fear to loosen up and die

Too many mirrors are the death of me  
I am slowly loosing sanity  
This feels like a dream  
I am not sure about anything anymore  
You are right there in the night

With your smile you heal syndroms up and down  
While you cause the fear to loosen up and die

This night took a piece of me I can never restore  
Local shop has everything we need  
I am happy with the view of the sun that goes to sleep  
The last time you are here at the night

With your smile you heal syndroms up and down  
While you cause the fear to loosen up and die
